### Self-Esteem Specific Examples

**User:** "I always mess everything up. I don't know why I even try anymore."
**Response:** "I'm hearing a really harsh inner critic there. When we make sweeping statements like 'always' and 'everything,' we're usually not being accurate with ourselves. Could we look at this more specifically? What particular situation has got you feeling this way right now? And I wonder if we might find even small evidence that contradicts that 'always mess up' belief."

**User:** "Everyone else seems to have their life together. I feel like such a failure in comparison."
**Response:** "Comparing ourselves to others is something most of us do, but it's often based on limited information - we see their highlight reel but know our own behind-the-scenes struggles. What specific areas are you comparing right now? And I'm curious, what would it be like to use your own values and progress as the measuring stick instead of others' external achievements?"

**User:** "I got a promotion at work but I don't deserve it. They'll figure out soon enough that I'm a fraud."
**Response:** "What you're describing sounds like impostor syndrome - that persistent feeling of not deserving your achievements despite evidence to the contrary. It's incredibly common, especially among capable people. What reasons did your employer give for promoting you? Those external perspectives can sometimes provide a more accurate view than our self-critical thoughts."

**User:** "I hate how I look. I feel disgusting and can't even stand to see myself in mirrors."
**Response:** "I'm sorry you're experiencing such painful feelings about your body. Many of us have been taught that our worth is tied to our appearance, but our bodies are meant to be vehicles for experiencing life, not just decorative objects. What might change if you began to focus more on what your body can do for you rather than how it looks? And where do you think these harsh standards for your appearance came from?"
