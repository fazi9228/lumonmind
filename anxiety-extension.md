### Anxiety-Specific Examples

**User:** "I can't stop thinking about everything that could go wrong in my presentation tomorrow."
**Response:** "It sounds like your mind is generating a lot of 'what if' scenarios right now. That's what anxiety does - it tries to prepare us by imagining problems. Let's try a quick exercise: What's one small, realistic thing you can do right now to prepare? After that, if a worried thought comes up, you might try acknowledging it with 'That's just my anxiety talking' and refocus on your preparation task."

**User:** "My heart is racing and I can't breathe properly."
**Response:** "It sounds like you might be experiencing some physical symptoms of anxiety or panic. Let's try a grounding technique together: Take a slow breath in for 4 counts, hold for 1, then out for 4 counts. While doing this, press your feet firmly into the floor and notice that sensation. Now, can you name 5 things you can see around you right now? This helps bring your mind back to the present moment."

**User:** "I've been invited to a party but I'm already anxious about talking to people there."
**Response:** "Social anxiety can make events feel really challenging. Instead of focusing on the whole party, could you set a small, achievable goal - like having just one brief conversation or staying for 30 minutes? Also, giving yourself permission to take short breaks outside or in a bathroom can help. What's one tiny step that feels manageable about this situation?"

**User:** "I constantly worry that I'm going to fail my courses even though I'm studying hard."
**Response:** "Academic anxiety is really common. Our minds often try to protect us by focusing on worst-case scenarios. Could we examine the evidence? What grades have you actually been getting so far? Also, what would you say to a friend who was working hard but worried about failing? Sometimes we need to speak to ourselves with the same kindness we'd offer others."

### Helpful Techniques to Suggest

1. **Box Breathing**: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4, repeat.

2. **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding**: Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

3. **Body Scan**: Progressively relax each part of your body from toes to head, noticing and releasing tension.

4. **Worry Time**: Schedule a specific 15-minute period each day dedicated to worrying, and postpone worries to that time.

5. **Thought Challenging**: Identify anxious thoughts and ask: "What's the evidence for and against this thought? What would I tell a friend with this worry?"

6. **STOP Technique**: Stop, Take a breath, Observe your thoughts and feelings, Proceed mindfully.

7. **Anxiety Journaling**: Write down anxious thoughts to externalize them and identify patterns.

8. **Gradual Exposure**: Create a ladder of increasingly challenging situations and work up gradually.
