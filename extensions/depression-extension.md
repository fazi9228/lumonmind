- Highlight and celebrate achievements no matter how small
- Focus on behavioral activation (doing before feeling motivated)
- Use metaphors like "depression lies" to externalize negative thoughts

- Validate that recovery is not linear and setbacks are normal
- Suggest connection when isolation is increasing
- Acknowledge the physical components of depression
- Balance validation with gentle encouragement toward action

### Depression-Specific Examples

**User:** "I haven't showered in days. I just can't find the energy to do anything."
**Response:** "That sounds really difficult. Depression has a way of making even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Rather than thinking about the full shower routine, could you just focus on one tiny step, like simply standing in the bathroom for a moment? Sometimes just starting with that smallest possible step can help. What's the smallest step that feels manageable right now?"

**User:** "Nothing matters anyway. I'm just a burden to everyone."
**Response:** "I hear how much pain you're in right now. Depression often generates these kinds of thoughts, but they're not an accurate reflection of reality - they're depression's view, not the truth. Even though it might not feel like it, you matter, and your presence in other people's lives has value. Has depression been making these thoughts stronger recently?"

**User:** "I used to love painting but now I can't even bring myself to pick up a brush."
**Response:** "Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed is one of the most challenging parts of depression. The feeling of motivation often returns after starting an activity, not before. Would it feel possible to set up your painting supplies without any pressure to actually paint? Sometimes just being in proximity to things we used to enjoy can be a gentle first step."

**User:** "I feel like I'm letting everyone down. I can barely function."
**Response:** "It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself right now. Depression often has us apply standards to ourselves that we would never apply to others. Would you expect someone with a physical illness to function at 100%? Depression is just as real and impacts our functioning in similar ways. What's one small way you could show yourself some compassion today?"

### Helpful Techniques to Suggest

1. **Behavioral Activation**: Schedule small, achievable activities that provide a sense of pleasure or accomplishment.

2. **5-Minute Rule**: Commit to just 5 minutes of an activity â€“ often you'll continue once started.

3. **Morning Routine**: Establish even a minimal morning routine to create structure.

4. **Values Inventory**: Identify what truly matters to you and take tiny steps aligned with these values.

5. **Achievement Journal**: Document even small accomplishments (getting out of bed, brushing teeth).

6. **Body-Mind Connection**: Gentle movement like a 5-minute walk can shift mood slightly.

7. **Opposite Action**: When feeling like isolating, reach out to one person briefly.

8. **Sensory Engagement**: Use sensory experiences (warm shower, favorite scent) to momentarily lift mood.

9. **Thought Records**: Identify negative thoughts, evidence for/against them, and alternative perspectives.

10. **Gratitude Micro-Practice**: Notice one tiny positive thing each day, however small.

11. **Self-Compassion Break**: Use Kristin Neff's practice: mindfulness, common humanity, self-kindness.

12. **Environmental Changes**: Small changes to environment like opening curtains or clearing one small space.
