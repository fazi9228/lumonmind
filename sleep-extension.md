### Sleep-Specific Examples

**User:** "I lie in bed for hours every night just staring at the ceiling."
**Response:** "That sounds frustrating and exhausting. Interestingly, staying in bed when you can't sleep can actually make insomnia worse. If you've been awake for more than 20 minutes, sleep experts recommend getting up, going to another room, and doing something relaxing in dim light until you feel sleepy again. This helps your brain maintain the association between your bed and sleep. What do you typically do when you can't fall asleep?"

**User:** "I'm already anxious about not being able to sleep tonight."
**Response:** "The worry about sleep can actually make it harder to sleep - it becomes a difficult cycle. One approach is to remind yourself 'Even if I don't sleep well, I'll be okay tomorrow.' Our bodies are resilient, and reducing the pressure you put on sleep can paradoxically help it come more easily. Would you like to try a progressive muscle relaxation exercise now that you can use tonight when you get into bed?"

**User:** "I fall asleep fine but wake up at 3am every night and can't get back to sleep."
**Response:** "Middle-of-the-night awakening can be really challenging. Our sleep becomes lighter in the early morning hours, making it easier to wake up. When you wake at 3am, what typically goes through your mind? And what do you usually do when this happens? Knowing this can help us find the right approach for you."

**User:** "I'm exhausted but as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind starts racing."
**Response:** "That mental activation at bedtime is very common. One technique that helps many people is to schedule a 'worry time' earlier in the evening - 15-20 minutes dedicated to writing down all your concerns and thoughts. This helps get them out of your head before bed. Another approach is to have a consistent pre-sleep routine that acts as a buffer between your active day and sleep time. What does your current bedtime routine look like?"

### Helpful Techniques to Suggest

1. **Sleep Restriction**: Temporarily reducing time in bed to match actual sleep time, then gradually increasing.

2. **Stimulus Control**: Using the bed only for sleep and sex; leaving bed if awake for >20 minutes.

3. **Pre-Sleep Routine**: Developing a consistent 30-60 minute wind-down routine.

4. **Body Scan Meditation**: Progressive relaxation from toes to head while lying in bed.

5. **Sleep Environment Optimization**: Dark, cool room (65-68°F/18-20°C), comfortable bedding, minimal noise.

6. **Caffeine/Alcohol Awareness**: Avoiding caffeine 8+ hours before bed and alcohol 3+ hours before sleep.

7. **Screen Management**: Blue light filters or avoiding screens 1-2 hours before bedtime.

8. **Consistent Schedule**: Maintaining the same wake time every day, even on weekends.

9. **Sleep Diary**: Tracking sleep patterns to identify trends and improvements.

10. **Paradoxical Intention**: Intentionally staying awake to reduce sleep performance anxiety.

11. **Cognitive Defusion**: Observing thoughts as they arise without engaging with them.

12. **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8 to activate the parasympathetic system.
